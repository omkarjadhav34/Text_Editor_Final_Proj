2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock vga_clk/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_core and tck_dtmcs are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_core] -to [get_clocks tck_dtmcs]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks tck_dtmcs and clk_core are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks tck_dtmcs] -to [get_clocks clk_core]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_core and tck_dtmcs are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_core] -to [get_clocks tck_dtmcs]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks tck_dtmcs and clk_core are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks tck_dtmcs] -to [get_clocks clk_core]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT clk_gen/swervolfn_0_36944_BUFG_inst_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-14#2 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT swervolf/timer_ptc/rptc_cntr[31]_i_8 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology.

Asynchronous driver check  
DSP swervolf/swerv_eh1/swerv/exu/mul_e1/prod_e20__2 input pin swervolf/swerv_eh1/swerv/exu/mul_e1/prod_e20__2/B[4] is connected to registers with an asynchronous reset. This is preventing the possibility of merging these registers in to the DSP Block since the DSP block registers only possess synchronous reset capability.  It is suggested to recode or change these registers to remove the reset or use a synchronous reset to get the best optimization for performance, power and area.
